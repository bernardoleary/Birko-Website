            Our goal is to provide the best football environment, that will enable the widest range of opportunities for our players with elite aspirations.

            <strong>BUAFC - Talent Development Programme (TDP) - NZ Football Licence</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In 2020 NZ Football introduced their new Talent Development Programme across all federations (for more information click here below) <a href="https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/DEVELOPMENT/Talent-Development" target="_blank">https://www.nzfootball.co.nz/DEVELOPMENT/Talent-Development</a>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In line with these changes, we are continuing to evolve our Talent Development Programme to meet and exceed the standards set by the licensing requirements.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This takes the form of several 'core' objectives which are required to be delivered. Club Licensing requires the club to produce competitive teams at 13th grade every season to ensure continued participation within the Regional Youth League ( NRFL ). Participation at all age grades in (preferably) both genders is required, in order to maintain a protected league status, with no threat of relegation.  This allows for a full commitment to the long-term development of our players.

            <strong>Talent Development Programme - Squad Selections for 2022</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The squad will be selected through a review of:
            <br/>
            &bull; Term 4 training performance 
            <br/>
            &bull; 2021 football season performances
            <br/>
            &bull; Trials/Training in February/March 2022. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Selections will be completed by BUAFC Head of Football and BUAFC qualified coaches.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The initial selections will be completed in late February / early March 2022.  16-18 players will be selected at this time with the opportunity for selection to the final places through March 2022.  The Final NRFL squad will be kept to a maximum of 16 players, as this will guarantee as much game time as possible for all players.  Players that missed out on selection but have the relevant skills and desire to be developed further, may be invited to practice and/or games during the season and will be monitored accordingly.  We encourage every single player to be at their best at every training and game irrespective of whether they have made the initial selection or not, because we are always looking to support everyone showing the required commitment.

            <strong>Talent Development Programme - U13's/U14's/U15's Fees 2022</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The club is committed to improved transparency around fees and has provided additional details of the cost base associated with how player fees are calculated (below).  Further, the club has also taken measures to improve the value players and parents receive by significantly improving the quality of coaching and the technical program delivery that is being offered to our footballers. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As the TDP requires more commitment, in terms of time and resources from each family involved, BUAFC has decided to lower the coaching fees from  $570 in 2021 to $500 for the entire 2022 season (30 weeks of training and games across three terms) PLUS the Club Membership fee of $220 (including GST).  This includes playing and training apparel and equates to around $16.50 per week, which is excellent value for professional coaching and apparel, particularly in comparison to many other sports or TDP offerings in Auckland.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This season three payment options are available, to offer more flexibility and convenience to our players and parents.  Please note, the club reserves the right to reconsider or reallocate any offered position if payment is not received within the prescribed times or option selected.
